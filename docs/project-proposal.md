# 🛣️  Real-time Road Condition Reporter

## Overview
The Real-time Road Condition Reporter is an IoT-based system designed to monitor, analyze, and report road surface conditions in real-time. Using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera mounted on a vehicle, the system collects data on road surfaces, detects issues (e.g., potholes, cracks), and communicates these findings to a centralized server. The project aims to improve road safety and inform infrastructure maintenance decisions.

## Objectives
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Gather road condition data continuously using a Raspberry Pi and camera.
- **Data Processing**: Detect road surface issues using AI-based image processing, specifically YOLOv8 from Ultralytics.
- **Wireless Communication** 📡: Send analyzed data to a remote server for aggregation.
- **User Interface** 💻: Provide real-time feedback on road conditions through a user interface accessible via web and mobile applications.
- **Infrastructure Insights** 🏗️: Aggregate data in a database to identify frequently problematic areas, helping road maintenance agencies prioritize repairs.

## System Design
### Components
1. **Data Collection Module** 📷: 
   - Raspberry Pi with a mounted camera on the backside of the car captures road surface images.
   - Images are processed locally on the Raspberry Pi using a REST API to gather road condition data.
   
2. **Image Processing and Analysis** 🧠:
   - Using YOLOv8 AI model on the Raspberry Pi, analyze captured images to detect road issues.
   
3. **Data Aggregation and Storage** 🗄️:
   - A microservice-based backend with a central database stores all analyzed road condition data.
   - Data is aggregated and preprocessed before analysis and storage.

4. **Wireless Communication Module** 📡:
   - A wireless communication module sends data from the Raspberry Pi to the backend system.
   
5. **Real-Time Data Analysis and Model Prediction** 📊:
   - The backend performs additional data analysis and prediction on the aggregated data, providing insights and potential hazard warnings.

6. **User Interface** 💻:
   - A web and mobile interface allows users to view real-time road condition data and alerts.

### Advantages
- **Improves Traffic Flow** 🚦: Real-time reporting helps drivers avoid damaged roads.
- **Enhances Safety** 🛡️: Early detection of road issues reduces accidents and enables timely repair.

### Disadvantages
- **Adoption Requirement**: Effectiveness depends on widespread adoption by vehicles.
- **Data Accuracy Challenges**: Variability in camera quality and conditions may affect data accuracy.
